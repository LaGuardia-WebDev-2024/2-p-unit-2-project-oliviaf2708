        <h1>Best places to go in Paris</h1> 

        <p>Paris is beautiful, but the city is huge, the streets can be<br>
           confusing, and you can get lost if you don't speek french. Here<br> 
           are just some places to put on your list if you ever find youself<br> 
           visiting!</p>

        <h2>Le Marais</h2>

        <p>This is a neighberhood in the 4th arrondissement, or South Marais.<br>
           There are lots of galleries, stores, and delicious restaurants<br>
           which are perfect for a nice diner. This neighberhood also serves as<br>
           a good area to find your hotel. There are countless beautiful squares<br>
           and parks that are convenient to be located near.<br>

        <h2>Avenue des Champs-Élysées</h2>

        <p>Champs-Élysées is the stret leading up to the Arch de Triumph.<br> 
           There are tons of stores to go into, ranging from Chanel to Levi's.<br>
           Along the walk, you could also see a mix of theatres and cafes. The<br>
           famous Ladurée Bakery can also be spotted, which have the best<br>
           macarons, in my opinion.<br>
