        <h1>Best places to go in Paris</h1> 

        <p>Paris is beautiful, but the city<br>
           is huge, the streets can be<br>
           confusing, and you can get lost<br>
           if you don't speek french. Here<br> 
           are just some places to put on<br>
           your list if you ever find 
           youself visiting!</p>

        <h2>Le Marais</h2>

        <p>This is a neighberhood in the 4th<br> 
           arrondissement, or South Marais.<br>
           There are lots of galleries,<br>
           stores, and delicious restaurants<br>
           which are perfect for a nice diner.<br>
           This neighberhood also serves as a<br> 
           good area to find your hotel. There<br>
           are countless beautiful squares and<br> 
           parks that are convenient to be<br>
           located near.<br>
        </p>

        <h2>Avenue des Champs-Élysées</h2>

        <p>Champs-Élysées is the stret leading<br>
           up to the Arch de Triumph. There are<br>
           tons of stores to go into, ranging from<br>
           Chanel to Levi's. Along the walk, you<br> 
           could also see a mix of theatres and<br> 
           cafes. The famous Ladurée Bakery can<br>
           also be spotted, which have the best<br>
           macarons, in my opinion.</p>
